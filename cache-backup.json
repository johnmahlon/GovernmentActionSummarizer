    "title": "Proclamation Restricting Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers",
    "summary": "A presidential proclamation restricting entry of certain nonimmigrant workers into the United States. The proclamation notes that the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary high skilled workers to perform additive labor, but has been used in ways that replace American workers with lower paid, lower skilled labor. The objective of the proclamation is to protect American workers and maintain wage and labor market integrity by limiting entry for specific nonimmigrant categories and directing federal agencies to implement and enforce the restrictions. The document outlines the scope of the restrictions and the administrative steps for enforcement, reflecting a policy recalibration of entry requirements for nonimmigrant workers.",
