    "title": "Proclamation Restricting Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers",
    "summary": "The proclamation states that the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary, high-skilled workers to the United States but has been used to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor. It notes concerns about large-scale displacement of American workers by nonimmigrant workers and announces restrictions on the entry of certain nonimmigrant workers to address these concerns. The proclamation directs relevant federal agencies to implement and enforce these entry restrictions and to establish procedures for compliance, including potential exemptions or adaptations as provided by law. The action reflects an objective to protect domestic labor markets by adjusting entry policies for nonimmigrant workers.",
