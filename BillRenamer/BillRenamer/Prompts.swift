1. Focus on the factual content and primary objectives of the bill or order.
2. Avoid emotionally charged or value-laden words.
3. Maintain clarity and conciseness.
4. Use neutral language that does not favor any political perspective.
5. Do not use any Markdown formatting
6. Focus on what an average U.S. Citizen would care about and their perspective
7. Provide context for things an average U.S. Citizen may not know
