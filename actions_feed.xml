            <title><![CDATA[Executive Order on Strengthening Family Stability and Foster Care Policy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[This executive order articulates the administration's policy to support parents in raising children in safe and loving homes and to address situations in which crises prevent family-based care by strengthening the foster care system. It directs federal agencies to coordinate efforts to protect the welfare of children, promote family preservation and stability, support foster families, and ensure safe and appropriate arrangements for children when family-based care is not possible. The order emphasizes interagency collaboration, review of existing child welfare laws and programs, and the development of policies intended to improve safety, permanency, and well-being for children involved with foster care.
