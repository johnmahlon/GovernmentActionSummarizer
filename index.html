It states that illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic and references a very small threshold quantity, such as two milligrams, to illustrate its potency. The designation enables the use of weapon of mass destruction authorities and related policy measures to disrupt production, trafficking, and distribution, and to strengthen enforcement and regulatory actions by relevant agencies.
