### Disclaimer
This script and feed uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze Presidential Actions. While AI can be a powerful tool for analysis, its limitations and potential biases should be acknowledged.

- Biased output: The bias rating provided by this script is based on a pre-existing scale that may not accurately capture the nuances of language or perspectives.
- Limited contextual understanding: AI models may struggle to understand the full context of a text, leading to misinterpretations or oversimplifications.
- Language variability: Natural language is inherently complex and variable, which can lead to inconsistencies in the output.
- Dependence on training data: The accuracy and fairness of this script are only as good as the quality and diversity of its training data.

By using this script, you acknowledge that its outputs should not be considered definitive or exhaustive. Take any analysis results with a grain of salt and consider multiple sources before making decisions.
