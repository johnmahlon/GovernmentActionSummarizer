            <title><![CDATA[Memorandum on Addressing Misleading Direct-To-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertisements and FDA Regulatory Authority]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[This presidential memorandum directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to address issues arising from direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. The document notes that Congressional authority to regulate prescription drug advertising was established in 1962 and affirms the FDA's regulatory remit over such advertising. It highlights concerns that some DTC advertisements may misstate the risks and benefits of medications, encourage reliance on medications over lifestyle changes, potentially interfere with the physician-patient relationship, and disproportionately promote higher-cost drugs over cheaper options. The memorandum calls for a comprehensive review of current DTC advertising practices and consideration of steps within the FDAâ€™s regulatory authority to improve accuracy, increase transparency, protect consumers, and align advertising standards with public health objectives.
